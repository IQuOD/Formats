Data format development

The IQuOD formats task team aim to develop a data format based on the Argo data format. The reasoning is:
  1. The Argo dataset is widely used and the IQuOD dataset will compliment it and make it easy to use if it is in a similar format
  2. The IQuOD project does not want to invent another new format.
  
The repository has been set up to contain ideas and development of code to create Argo-based netcdf files from the WOD dataset. Initially, the output from the task team will be summarised in the following documents:

* [ArgoFormatsComments.md](ArgoFormatsComments.md): general notes and comments on the Argo format;
* [IQuOD_Formats.md](IQuOD_Formats.md): requirements and recommendations for the IQuOD formats.
